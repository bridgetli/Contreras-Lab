# Contreras-Lab
Coding projects I've completed for the Contreras Lab at UT Austin. All code written independently.

Each folder contains a different project.
Some folders contain subfolders. These are for when the same base code had to be run on multiple different datasets and required some modification.
Please see .py files inside folders for code and descriptions about what the code does.
The rest of the files in each folder are inputs or outputs.
