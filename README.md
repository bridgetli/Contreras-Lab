# Contreras-Lab
Code I've written for my research position in the Contreras Lab at UT Austin as a high school student.

### Code use:
Each folder contains a different project.
Some folders contain subfolders. These are for when the same base code had to be run on multiple different datasets and required some modification.

Please see .py files inside folders for code and descriptions about what the code does.
The rest of the files in each folder are inputs or outputs.

### Project summaries:
Mihailovic, M. K., Ekdahl, A., Chen, A., Leistra, A. N., Li, B., Javier González Martínez, Law, M., Ejindu, C., Massé, E., Freddolino, P. L., & Contreras, L. M. (2021). <b>Uncovering Transcriptional Regulators and Targets of sRNAs Using an Integrative Data-Mining Approach: H-NS-Regulated RseX as a Case Study</b>. <i>Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology, 11</i>. https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.696533

Wrote code to find positional overlap between likely functional regions (“hot regions”) and computationally-predicted interactions between the RNA of interest and potential mRNA targets. This identifies mRNA candidates for experimental confirmation. See "filtering-IntaRNA-predictions" for code.

Wrote code to identify sRNA-associated differential protein occupancy from IPOD-HR data. Also wrote code to identify putative DNA-binding proteins from MEME analysis.
